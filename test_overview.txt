tests

unit tests - validate functions, algorithms, and calculations.
  - calculated optimal path distance is within 30% of the true direct route.
  - the pathfinding algorithm clearly avoids known obstacles.
  - weather api response is clearly displayed onto the frontend.

integration tests - validate system component interaction.
  - frontend-backend api communication.
  - a path is able to be calculated from end to end.
  - mission submission workflow is able to be completed.

system tests - validate user workflow.
  - full user journey (login -> mission -> results).
  - error handling (api failures, invalid inputs).
  - cors and authentication.

performance tests - validate performance of the system.
  - path calculation time (< 30s).
  - api response times.
  - map rendering performance.
